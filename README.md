Branches
========
Each branch represents a significant milestone in the project's growth towards, what can be considered, a basic Operating System.

**iProject1** formulated the fundamentals and helped to create a base off of which to work.

**iProject2** introduced the CPU with its ability to run a single program from memory.

**iProject3** tripled the standard by allowing up to three (3) programs to execute concurrently.

**iProject4** brought all of the facets together by creating a Disk Drive that not only allows programs to roll into and out of via a swapper, but to also act as a raw File System for storage.

Commits made beyond a branch (specifically after 12/15/19) are for the purposes of maintenance, personal upgrades, and refactoring. Enjoy!
